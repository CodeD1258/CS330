#Project Reflection

Working on the 3D lamp and shapes project helped me refine both my software design and development skills in a spatial and visual context. I approach designing software by breaking complex systems into smaller, manageable components and planning how each element interacts in the scene. For this project, I focused on modular design by representing the lamp, its segments, and other shapes as separate objects with clear relationships, which made it easier to manipulate joints, pivots, and rotations independently. Iteration played a key role in my process. I would adjust positions, angles, and rotations, then observe how the lamp moved and how shadows and lighting appeared, refining both the geometry and the visual realism over time. This approach of planning, testing, and refining allowed me to create a dynamic, interactive 3D scene and has given me strategies I can apply to future projects, such as structuring code and models for flexibility and designing with the userâ€™s perspective in mind.

On the development side, I implemented the core shapes and joints first, then gradually layered in enhancements like realistic pivoting, rotation constraints, and visual aesthetics. Through this, I learned to combine practical coding techniques with creative problem-solving, especially in translating real-world mechanics into a virtual environment. Working with computational graphics and 3D visualizations taught me how to make abstract spatial concepts tangible and interactive. These experiences not only strengthened my technical and spatial reasoning skills but also expanded my ability to communicate ideas visually and programmatically. Moving forward, the lessons learned here were modular design, iterative development, and realistic visual feedback. It will be invaluable in both my educational projects and future professional work in fields such as 3D modeling, simulations, or interactive applications.
